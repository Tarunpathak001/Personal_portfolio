Hi, I’m Tarun Pathak
CS Undergrad | Aspiring Software Engineer & AI Researcher

I am a Computer Science student exploring the intersection of scalable web systems, machine learning foundations, and low-level software engineering. I am not just learning to code; I am learning to engineer systems that are robust, efficient, and inspectable.

My goal is to master the full stack—from how a kernel handles a container to how a neural network processes language.
